    <h1>Lighting</h1>
</div>
   
    <p>Lighting is very important when it comes to photography and videography, it is one of the key components of setting up the mood of a scene. 
         
        In DGA1019 and DGA1020 we learned the fundamentals of lighting and how we can use it to our advantage to create interesting scenes.

         <h2>The Three Point Setup</h2>
         
         <p> The <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-three-point-lighting-learn-about-the-lighting-technique-and-tips-for-the-best-three-point-lighting-setups" target="_blank" title="More info about three point setup">three point setup</a> is one of the most commonly used setups when it comes to lighting up a subject or a composition. It is used a lot when it comes to portraiture, still lifes and product photography. 
    
            This setup consists of 3 lights hence the name three point setup. The lights used in this type of setup are called the Fill light, Key light and Back light.
            </p>
         
          <h2>Highlights And Shadows</h2>
        
          <p>To create a nice balance of shadow and light one must pay attention to the:
            
            <ul>
           
            <li>The intensity of the light</li>
            <li>The colour of the light</li> 
            <li>The positioning</li> 
      
        </ul>

        <h2>DGA 1019</h2>
        
        <p>In DGA 1019 we where tasked to create christmas themed portraitures. Apart from the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/mt/creativecloud/photography/discover/photo-composition.html" target="_blank" title="More info about composition">composition</a> I also paid attention to my lighting setup. 
           
            Since it was the holidays and I was spending a lot of time at my house I decided to create a three point lighting setup out of everyday lamps and lights. 
            
            Here are the photos of the setup I had created and the results:

        <h2>DGA 1020</h2>
        
        <p>The other task which included lighting as a fundamental element was the task in DGA 1020 where we had to create a short video of a composition with a moving object in it.
        Here is a photo of the lighting setup and the video result:
